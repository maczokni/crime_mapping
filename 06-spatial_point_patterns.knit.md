# Mapping hot spots of crime: spatial point patterns and isarithmic maps

## Introduction

A key piece of information we explore in environmental criminology is the "exact" location of crimes, typically in the form of street address in which a crime is recorded as having occurred. A key goal of the analysis of this type of mapped point data is to detect patterns, in particular to detect areas where crime locations appear as clustered and reflecting an increased likelihood of occurrence. 

In chapter 1, we generated some maps with point locations representing crimes in Greater Manchester (UK) and we saw how the large volume of events made it difficult to discern any spatial pattern. In previous chapters we saw how we could deal with this via aggregation of the point data to enumeration areas such census tracts or by virtue of binning. In this chapter we will introduce techniques that are used as an alternative visualisation for point patterns and that are based on the mathematics of density estimation. They are used to produce isarithmic maps, these are the kind of maps you often see in the weather reports displaying temperature. What we are doing is creating an interpolated surface from discrete data points. Or in simpler terms we are "effectively inventing data values for the areas on the map for which you don't have data or sample points" (http://cartonerd.blogspot.com/2015/02/when-is-heat-map-not-heat-map.html).

Before we get to the detail of how we produce these maps we will briefly and very generally introduce the field of spatial point pattern analysis. The analysis of discrete locations are a subfield of spatial statistics. In this chapter we will indeed introduce a new R package called `spatstat`, that was developed for spatial point pattern analysis and modelling. It was written by Adrian Baddeley and Rolf Turner. There is a [webpage](http://spatstat.org) dedicated to this package. The [thickest book](https://www.crcpress.com/Spatial-Point-Patterns-Methodology-and-Applications-with-R/Baddeley-Rubak-Turner/p/book/9781482210200) in our library, at 810 pages, is dedicated to this package. So as you can imagine the theory and practice of spatial pattern analysis is something one could devote an entire volume to. You can get a pdf document used in a course the authors of this package develop [here](https://research.csiro.au/software/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2015/02/Rspatialcourse_CMIS_PDF-Standard.pdf). In our book we are only going to provide you with an introductory practical entry into this field of techniques. If this package is not installed in your machine, make sure you install it before we carry on. In this chapter we will also be using the package `crimedata` developed by our colleague Matt Ashby, which you would also need to install.


```r
library(readr)
library(sf)
library(tmap)
library(dplyr)
library(spatstat)
library(maptools)
library(crimedata)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Getting the data: introducing crimedata

Dr. Ashby is the lead contributor to the **Crime Open Database (CODE)**, a service that makes it convenient to use crime data from multiple US cities in research on crime. All the data in CODE are available to use for free as long as you acknowledge the source of the data. The package `crimedata` was developed by Dr. Ashby to make it easier to read into R the data from this service.

The key function in `crimedata`  is `get_crime_data()`. We will be using the crime data from New York City police and for 2019, and we want the data to be in `sf` format. We will also filter the data to only include residential burglaries in Brooklyn. Equally we will download the geojson with the borough boundaries from the NYC open data portal. See the code below for details:


```r
## Large dataset, so it will take a while
nyc_burg <- get_crime_data(
  cities = "New York", #specifies the city for which you want the data
  years = 2019,        #reads the appropriate year of data
  type = "extended",   #you can select core fields, extended (a fuller set of                          fields), or sample
  output = "sf"        #Specified whether you want a sf objet with WGS84 or a                          tibble
) %>%
  filter(offense_type == "residential burglary/breaking & entering" &
           nyc_boro_nm == "BROOKLYN")
```
