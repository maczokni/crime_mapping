# Preamble: how to use this book

This book aims to provide the reader with an introduction to R as an engine for spatial data visualisation and analysis for those interested in crime analysis and criminology. The book is based in our lab materials for course units we offer to upper level undergraduate and MA students on criminology interested in crime mapping, as well as in similar material we have used when training crime analysts working for the police or other law enfocerment agencies. As such it is easier to use it as material that can be used as a companion text for simlar course units in crime mapping, the geography of crime, environmental criminology, or crime analysis. Equally, it can be used by students, practitioners, and academics alike interested in learning more about R and its GIS and spatial analysis capacity. It is not an advanced statistics text, but rather an applied text. It is written as a text that can be use for someone "self teaching" R and, thus, unlike reference books, it is better to read and practice each chapter in sequence.

Crime mapping and analysis sits at the intersection of geocomputation, data visualisation and cartography, spatial statistics, environmental criminology, and crime analysis. Environmental criminology provides the substantive background. It concerns the analysis of the spatial and geographical distribution of crime. This text cannot make justice to each of this bodies of enquiry, professional practice, and literature. We cannot offer a comprehensive and systematice treatment of each of these areas. What we do is provide a, we hope helpful, introduction to R as a way to bring together these specialties and offer adequate references to our readers so that they can deepen their understanding of each of them.
