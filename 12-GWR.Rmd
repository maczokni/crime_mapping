# Chapter 14: Spatial heterogeneity and regression: Geographically weighted regression

[[Already have an introduction to spatial hetereogeneity in the intro to the next chapter, where we say we will talk about solutions here. It possibly makes sense to move here the business about spatial regimes and data partition as a first way to deal with spatial heterogeneity and then introduce GWR as a more localised solution]]
