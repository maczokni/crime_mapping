# Studying spatial point patterns


## What we'll do today

We have now covered quite a bit! You've learnt about spatial objects and various formats in which they come and are stored by R, how to produce maps using a variety of packages, and also provided you with a brief introduction to common spatial operations. In what remains of the semester we are going to shift the emphasis and start focusing a bit more on spatial statistics. First we will focus on techniques that are used to explore and analyse points in a geographical space and in subsequent sessions we will cover techniques that are used to analyse spatial data when our unit of analysis are polygons (e.g., postal code areas, census areas, police beats, etc).

We will introduce a new R package called `spatstat`, that was developed for spatial point pattern analysis and modelling. It was written by Adrian Baddeley and Rolf Turner. There is a [webpage](http://spatstat.org) dedicated to this package. The [thickest book](https://www.crcpress.com/Spatial-Point-Patterns-Methodology-and-Applications-with-R/Baddeley-Rubak-Turner/p/book/9781482210200) in my library, at 810 pages, is dedicated to this package. So as you can imagine the theory and practice of spatial pattern analysis is something one could devote an entire course to. You can get a pdf document used in a course the authors of this package develop [here](https://research.csiro.au/software/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2015/02/Rspatialcourse_CMIS_PDF-Standard.pdf). In our course we are only going to provide you with an introductory practical entry into this field of techniques. If this package is not installed in your machine, make sure you install it before we carry on.

## Getting the data

We will be using the crime data from Greater Manchester police we have been using so far. Let's focus on burglary in the Fallowfield area. The code below has already been explained and used in previous sessions, so we won't go over the detail again. But rather than cut and paste automatically, try to remember what each line of code is doing.

By the way, the police data for Manchester we have used in previous sessions correspond to only one month of the year. Here we are using a full year worth of data, so the data import will take a bit longer.


```r
#Read a geojson file with Manchester wards (remember we learned about geojson files in week 4)
manchester_ward <- st_read("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RUMgroup/Spatial-data-in-R/master/rumgroup/data/wards.geojson")
```

```
## Reading layer `wards' from data source `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RUMgroup/Spatial-data-in-R/master/rumgroup/data/wards.geojson' using driver `GeoJSON'
## Simple feature collection with 215 features and 12 fields
## geometry type:  POLYGON
## dimension:      XY
## bbox:           xmin: 351664 ymin: 381168.6 xmax: 406087.5 ymax: 421039.8
## projected CRS:  OSGB 1936 / British National Grid
```

```r
#Create a new object that only has the fallowfield ward
df1 <- manchester_ward %>%
  filter(wd16nm == "Fallowfield")

#Change coordinate systems
fallowfield <- st_transform(df1, 4326)

#Get rid of objects we no longer need
rm(manchester_ward)
rm(df1)

#Read Greater Manchester police data
crimes <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jjmedinaariza/CrimeMapping/master/gmpcrime.csv")
```

```

##   LSOA_name = col_character(),
##   crime_type = col_character(),
##   month = col_character()
## )
```

```r
burglary <- filter(crimes, crime_type == "Burglary")

#Transform the dataframe with crime information into a sf object
burglary_spatial = st_as_sf(burglary, coords = c("long", "lat"), 
                 crs = 4326, agr = "constant")

#Select only the crimes that take place within the space defined by the Ward boundaries
# intersection
bur_fal <- st_intersects(fallowfield, burglary_spatial)
```

```
## although coordinates are longitude/latitude, st_intersects assumes that they are planar
```

```r
# subsetting
bur_fal <- burglary_spatial[unlist(bur_fal),]
#again remove things we don't need
rm(crimes)
rm(burglary)
```

Now we have all our data cleaned and all our files prepared. Let's see the results!
