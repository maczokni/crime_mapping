# Chapter 10: Assessing local clusters and repeats

## Introduction

There has been a great interest within criminology and crime analysis in the study of local clusters of crime or hot spots over the last 30 years. Hot spots is the term typically used within criminology and crime analysis to refer to small geographical areas with a high concentration of crime. @Weisburd_2015 argues for a law of concentration of crime that postulates that a large proportion of crime events occur at relatively few places (such as specific addresses, street intersections, street blocks, or other small micro places) within larger geographical areas such as cities. In one of the earlier contributions to this field of research, @Sherman_1989 noted how roughly 3% of all addresses in Minneapolis (USA) generated about 50% of all calls to police services. A number of subsequent studies have confirmed this pattern elsewhere. @Steenbeek_2016 argue that, in fact, most of the variability of (58% to 69% in their data from The Hague) can be attributed to micro geographic units, with a very limited contribution from the neighbourhood level. This literature also argues that many crime hot spots are relatively stable over time (@Andresen_2011b; @Andresen_2017; @Andresen_2017b).

There is also now a considerable body of research evaluating police interventions that take this insight as key to shape their responses to crime. Hot spots policing , or place based policing, assumes that police can reduce crime by focusing their resources on the small number of places that generate a majority of crime problems. Policing crime hot spots has become a popular strategy in the US and efforts to adopt this approach have also taken place elsewhere. Theoretically one could use all sort of proactive creative approaches to solve crime in these locations (using for example conceptual and tactical tools from @Goldstein_1990 problem oriented policing approach), though too often in practice directed patrol becomes the default response. Recent reviews of the literature (dominated by US experiences) suggest the approach can have a small effect size (@Braga_2019), though some authors contend alternative measures of effect size (which are suggestive of a moderate effect) should be used instead (@Braga_2020). Whether these findings would replicate well in other contexts is still an open question (see, for example, @Collazos_2020)

In the previous chapter we explored ways to visualise the concentration of crime incidents in particular location. We used tesselation and kernel density estimation as a way to do this. As noted by @Chainey_2020:

>"Hot spot maps generated using KDE are useful for showing where crime concentrates but may fail to determine unambiguosly what is hot (in hot spot analysis terms) from what is not hot. That is, a KDE hot spot map may fail to separate the significant spatial concentrations of crime from those spatial distributions of less interest, or from random variation"

There are a number of tools that have been developed to detect local clusters. In crime analysis, for example, is common the use of the local $Gi^*$ statistic, which is a type of a **local indicator of spatial autocorrelation**. Whereas in spatial epidemiology a number of techniques have been developed for detecting areas with an unusually high risk of disease. Although originally developed in the context of studying disease, the techniques can also be applied to the study of crime. Most of the methods in spatial epidemiology are based on the idea of "moving windows", such as the spatial scan statistic developed by @Kulldorff_1997. Several packages bring this scan statistics to R. There are also other packages that use different algorithms to detect disease clusters, such as AMOEBA, that is based in the Getis-Ord algorithm. As we will see we are spoiled for choice in this regard.

## Burglaries in Manchester

We return to burglaries in Manchester for this chapter. The files we are loading include the geomasked locations of burglary occurrences in 2017, for the whole of Manchester city and separately for its city centre. Later in this chapter we will look at the whole of Manchester and we will use counts of burglary per LSOA, so we will also load this aggregated data now.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Create sf object with burglaries for Manchester city
manc_burglary <- st_read("data/manc_burglary_bng.geojson",
                         quiet=TRUE)
manc_burglary <- st_transform(manc_burglary , 4326)
# Create sf object with burglaries in city centre
cc_burglary <- st_read("data/manch_cc_burglary_bng.geojson",
                       quiet=TRUE)
cc_burglary <- st_transform(cc_burglary , 4326)
# Read the boundary for the Manchester city centre ward
city_centre <- st_read("data/manchester_wards.geojson", 
                       quiet = TRUE) %>%
  filter(wd16nm == "City Centre")
city_centre <- st_transform(city_centre, 4326)
# Read the boundary for Manchester city
manchester <- st_read("data/manchester_city_boundary_bng.geojson",
                      quiet = TRUE)
manchester <- st_transform(manchester , 4326)
# Read into R the count of burglaries per LSOA
burglary_lsoa <- st_read("data/burglary_manchester_lsoa.geojson",
                    quiet = TRUE)
# Place last file in projected British National Grid
burglary_lsoa <- st_transform(burglary_lsoa, 27700)

```


## Micro Grid Cells

[[[]]]

In chapter 4 we discussed alternatives to our choropleth maps, and one of these was to use a grid map. This is a process whereby a tessalating grid of a shape such as squares or hexagons is overlaid on top of our area of interest, and our points are aggregated to such a grid. We explored this using `ggplot2` package. We also used this approach when discussing quadrat counting with `ppp` objects and using the functionality provided by the `spatstat` package.

Here we can revisit this with another approach, using the `raster` package. First we need to create the grid for the raster using the `raster()` function. The first argument defines the extent for the grid. By using our "toronto" `sf` object we ensure it includes all of it. Then the `resolution` argument simply defines how large we want the cells in this grid to be. You can play around with this argument and see how the results will vary. Then we will use the `rasterize()` function to count the number of points that fall within each cell. This is just a form of quadrant counting as the one we introduced in Chapter 6. The `rasterize()` function takes as the first argument the coordinates of the points. The second argument provides the grid we just created. The `field` argument in this case is assigned a value of `1`  so that each point is counted a unit. Then we use the `fun` argument to specify we want to `"count"` the points within each cell. The `rasterize()` function by default will set at NA all the values where there are no points. We don´t want this to be the case. So that the raster include those cells as zero we use the `background` argument and set it to zero: 

```{r}
# Create empty raster grid
manchester_r <- raster(manchester, resolution = 0.004)
# Fill the grid with the count of incidents within each cell
m_burglary_raster <- rasterize(manc_burglary,
                                manchester_r,
                                field = 1,
                                fun = "count",
                                background = 0)
# Use base R functionality to plot the raster
plot(m_burglary_raster)
plot(st_geometry(manchester), border='#00000040', add=T)
```

This kind of map is helpful if you want to get a sense of the distribution over the whole city, but oftenwise from a crime analyst operational point of view the interest is at a larger scale of resolution. We want to deep in and observe the micro-places that may be attracting crime within certain parts of the city. We can do this by focusing on particular neighbourhoods.

Let´s look at Kthe city centre, the ward with one of the highest counts of burglaries.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Create empty grid for the City Centre
city_centre_r <- raster(city_centre, resolution = 0.0009)
# Produce raster object with the number of incidents within each cell
burglary_raster_cc <- rasterize(cc_burglary,
                                city_centre_r,
                                field = 1,
                                fun = "count",
                                background = 0)
# Plot results with base R
plot(burglary_raster_cc)
plot(st_geometry(city_centre), border='#00000040', add=T)
```

We don´t have in this raster object incidents outside the boundaries of the neighborhoud, so we could prefer to declare those cells as NAs. We can do that with the `raster::mask()` function.

```{r}
burglary_raster_cc <- mask(burglary_raster_cc, city_centre)
plot(burglary_raster_cc)
```

Let´s add some context. We will use `mapview` for it. This is another great package if you want to give your audience some interactivity. It does what is says in the tin: 
>it "provides functions to very quickly and conveniently create interactive visualisations of spatial data. Its main goal is to fill the gap of quick (not presentation grade) interactive plotting to examine and visually investigate both aspects of spatial data, the geometries and their attributes. It can also be considered a data-driven API for the leaflet package as it will automatically render correct map types, depending on the type of the data (points, lines, polygons, raster)." 

With very few lines of code you can get an interactive plot. Here we first will use `RColorBrewer::brewer.pal()` to define a convenient palette and then use `mapview::mapview()` to plot our raster. Below you see how we increase the transparency with the `alpha.region` argument and how we use `col.regions` to change from the default palette to the one we created.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

my.palette <- brewer.pal(n = 9, name = "OrRd")
mapview(burglary_raster_cc, 
        alpha.regions = 0.7,
        col.regions = my.palette)
```

## Local Getis-Ord

The maps above and the ones we introduced in chapter 6 produced through kernel density estimation are helpful for visualising the varying intensity of crime across the study region of interest. However, as we noted in Chapter 6, it may be hard to discern random variation from clustering of crime incidents simply using these techniques. There are a number of statistical tools that have been developed to extract the signal from the noise, to determine what is hot from random variation, and that were originally designed to detect clusters of disease.

In crime analysis is common to use a technique developed by Arthur Getis and JK Ord in the early 1990s (@Getis_1992 and @Ord_1995), partly because it was implemented in the widely successful ArcGIS as part of their hot spot analysis tool. This statistic provides a measure of spatial dependence at the local level. They are not testing homogeneity, they are testing dependence of a given attribute around neighbouring areas (which could be operationalised as micro cells in a grid, as above, or could be some form of administrative areas). 

Whereas the tests we covered in the previous chapter measure dependence at the global level (whereas areas are surrounded by alike areas), these measures of local clustering try to identify pockets of dependence. They are also called local indicators of spatial autocorrelation. It is indeed useful for us to be able to assess quantitatively whether crime events cluster in a non-random manner. in the words of Jerry @Ratcliffe_2010, however, "while a global Moran’s I test can show that crime events cluster in a non-random manner, this simply explains what most criminal justice students learn in their earliest classes." (p. 13). For a crime analyst and practitioner, whereas clustering is of interest, learning about the existence and location of local clusters is of paramount importance.

There are two variants of the local Getis-Ord statistic. The local $G$ is computed a ratio of the weighted average of the values of the attribute of interest in the neighboring locations, not including the value at the location. It is generally used for spread and diffusion studies. The local $G^*$ includes the value at the location in both numerator and denominator. It is more generally used for clustering studies. High positive values indicate the possibility of a local cluster of high values of the variable being analysed ("hot spot"), very low relative values a similar cluster of low values ("cold spot"). "A value larger than the mean (or, a positive value for a standardized z-value) suggests a High-High cluster or hot spot, a value smaller than the mean (or, negative for a z-value) indicates a Low-Low cluster or cold spot." (@Anselin_2020a) 

For statistical inference, a Bonferroni-type test is suggested in the the papers by Getis and Ord, where tables of critical values are included. The critical values for the 95th percentile under the assumptions discussed by @Ord_1995 are for $n$=30: 2.93, $n$=50: 3.08, $n$=100: 3.29, $n$=500: 3.71, and for $n$=1000: 3.89. @Anselin_2020a suggest that this analytical approximation may not be reliable in practice and that conditional permutation is advisable. Inference with these local measures are also complicated by problems of multiple comparisons, so it is typically advisable to use some form of adjustment to this problem.

The first step in computing the Getis and Ord statistics involves defining the neighbours of each area. And to do that first we have to turn each cell in our grid into a polygon, so we basically move from the raster to the vector model by virtue of using `raster::rasterToPolygons`. 

```{r}
# Move to vector model
getisgrid <-  rasterToPolygons(burglary_raster_cc)

```

What is a neighbour and the code related to defining neighbours is a topic we covered in the previous chapter. For brevity, we will only use the Queen criteria for this illustration. Only to indicate that `include.self()` ensures we get the $G^*$ variation of the local Getis-Ord test, the second variation we mentioned above.

```{r}
neighbors <-  poly2nb(getisgrid)
weighted_neighbors <- nb2listw(include.self(neighbors), zero.policy=T)


```

Now that we have the data ready we can, analytically, compute the statistic using the `localG()` function. We can then add the computed local $Gi^*$ to each cell.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSe}

# Perform the local G analysis (Getis-Ord GI*)
getisgrid$HOTSPOT_z <- as.vector(localG(getisgrid$layer, weighted_neighbors))


```

We can then see the produced z scores:

```{r}
summary(getisgrid$HOTSPOT_z)

```

How do you interpret these? They are z scores. So you expect large absolute values to index the existence of cold spots (if they are negative) or hot spots (if they are positive). Our sample size is 475 cells and there are only a very small handful of cells with values that reach the critical value in our dataset.

A known problem with this statistic is that of multiple comparisons. As noted by @Pebesma_2021: "although the apparent detection of hotspots from values of local indicators has been quite widely adopted, it remains fraught with difficulty because adjustment of the inferential basis to accommodate multiple comparisons is not often chosen." So we need to ensure the critical values we use adjust for this. We can use `stats::p.adjust()` to count the number of observations that this statistic identifies as hot spots using different solutions for the multiple comparison problem, such as Bonferroni, False Discovery Rate, or the method developed by Benjamini and Yekutielli (BY).

```{r}
p_values <- 2 * pnorm(abs(c(getisgrid$HOTSPOT_z)), lower.tail = FALSE)
p_values_mc <- cbind(p_values, 
              p.adjust(p_values, "bonferroni"), 
              p.adjust(p_values, "fdr"), 
              p.adjust(p_values, "BY"))
colnames(p_values_mc) <- c("None", "Bonferroni", 
                           "False Discovery Rate", "BY (2001)")
apply(p_values_mc, 2, function(x) sum(x < 0.05))
```

We can now plot this significant clusters in the map. First we will do some recoding to identify these cells in the spatial polygon object.

```{r}
# Creates p values for Bonferroni adjustment
getisgrid$HOTSPOT_bonf <- p.adjust(p_values, "bonferroni")
# Create character vector based on Z score and p values (since this is a spatial polygon tidier functions such as mutate won´t do the job and have to use base R)
getisgrid$HOTSPOT <- "Not significant"
getisgrid$HOTSPOT[getisgrid$HOTSPOT_bonf < 0.05 & getisgrid$HOTSPOT_z > 0] <- "Hot spot"
getisgrid$HOTSPOT[getisgrid$HOTSPOT_bonf < 0.05 & getisgrid$HOTSPOT_z < 0] <- "Cold spot"
table(getisgrid$HOTSPOT)

```

We can now map these values.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
tmap_mode("view")
map1 <- tm_shape(st_as_sf(getisgrid)) + 
  tm_fill(c("HOTSPOT_z"), 
          title="Z scores",
          alpha = 0.5)
map2 <- tm_shape(st_as_sf(getisgrid)) +
  tm_fill(c("HOTSPOT"), 
          title="Hot spots",
          alpha = 0.5)
tmap_arrange(map1, map2, nrow=1)


```

## Local Moran´s I and Moran scaterplot

The Local Gerdis and Ord statistic, as we noted is a type of local indicator of spatial autocorrelation. There is also a local version of Moran´s I, which allow for the  the decomposition of such as Moran's I, into the contribution of each observation. 

These LISA statistics serve two purposes. On one hand, they may be interpreted as indicators of local pockets of nonstationarity, or hot spots. On the other hand, they may be used to assess the influence of individual locations on the magnitude of the global statistic and to identify “outliers” (@Anselin_1995). @Anselin_1995 suggests that any LISA satisfies two requirements (p. 94:
"-a) the LISA for each observation gives an indication of the extent of significant spatial clustering of similar values around that observation;
- b) the sum of LISAs for all observations is proportional to a global indicator of spatial association".

Let's first look at the Moran's scatterplot for our data. Remember from last chapter that a Moran´s scatterplot is plotting the values of the variable of interest, in this case the burglary count on each micro grid, against the spatial lagged value. For creating the Moran´s scatterplot we generally use row standardisation in the weight matrix so that the Y and the X axis are more comparable.

```{r}
nb_queen <- poly2nb(getisgrid)
lw_queen_rs <-  nb2listw(nb_queen, style='W')
m_plot_burglary <- moran.plot(getisgrid$layer, lw_queen_rs,
           cex=1, 
           pch=".", 
           xlab="burglary count", 
           ylab="lagged burglary count")

```

Notice how the plot is split in 4 quadrants. The top right corner belongs to areas that have high level of burglary and are surrounded by other areas that have above the average level of burglary. These are **high-high** locations. The bottom left corner belongs to the **low-low areas**. These are areas with low level of burglary and surrounded by areas with below average levels of burglary. Both the high-high and low-low represent clusters. A high-high cluster is what you may refer to as a *hot spot*. And the low-low clusters represent *cold spots*. 

In the opposite diagonal we have **spatial outliers**. They are not outliers in the standard statistical sense, extreme observations, they are outliers in that they are surrounded by areas that are very unlike them. So you could have *high-low spatial outliers*, areas with high levels of burglary and low levels of surrounding burglary, or *low-high spatial outliers*, areas that have themselves low levels of burglary (or whatever else we are mapping) and that are surrounded by areas with above average levels of burglary.

The slope of the line in the scatterplot gives you a measure of the global spatial autocorrelation. As we noted earlier, the local Moran´s I  help you to identify what are the locations that weigh more heavily in the computation of the global Moran´s I. The object generated by the `moran.plot()` function includes a measure of this influence for each location in your study area and we can plot these values if we want to geographically visualise those locations:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# We extract the influence measure and place it in the sp object
getisgrid$hat <- m_plot_burglary$hat
# Then we can plot this measure of influence
tm_shape(getisgrid) + tm_fill("hat")

```

To compute the local Moran we can use a function from the `spdep` package: `localmoran()`.

```{r}
locm_burglary <- localmoran(getisgrid$layer, lw_queen_rs,
                            alternative = "two.sided")
summary(locm_burglary)
```

The first column provides the summary statistic for the local moran statistic. Being local you will have one for each of the areas. The last column gives you a p value for this statistic. 

### Creating a LISA map

In order to produce the LISA map we need to do some previous work. First we are going to create some new variables that we are going to need.

First we scale the variable of interest. When we scale burglary what we are doing is re-scaling the values so that the mean is zero. We use `scale()`, which is a generic function whose default method centers and/or scales the variable. Here centering is done by subtracting the mean (omitting NAs) the corresponding columns, and scaling is done by dividing the (centered) variable by their standard deviations.We've also added `as.vector()` to the end, to make sure that the data type we get out of this is a vector, that maps neatly into our dataframe.

```{r}

burglary_m$s_burglary <- scale(burglary_m$burglary) %>% as.vector()
```

To produce the LISA maps we also need to generate a **spatial lag**: the average value of the burglary count in the areas that are considered neighbours of each LSOA. 

For this we need our `listw` object, which is the `ww` object created earlier, when we generated the list with weights using row standardisation. We then pass this `listw` object into the `lag.listw()` function, which computes  the spatial lag of a numeric vector using a `listw` sparse representation of a spatial weights matrix. 

```{r}
#create a spatial lag variable and save it to a new column
burglary_m$lag_s_burglary <- lag.listw(lw_m, burglary_m$s_burglary)
```

Make sure to check the summaries to ensure nothing weird is going on

```{r}

summary(burglary_m$s_burglary)
summary(burglary_m$lag_s_burglary)
```

We can create a Moran scatter plot so that you see that nothing has changed apart from the scale in winch we are using the variables. The observations that are influential are highlighted in the plot as you can see.

```{r}
x <- burglary_m$s_burglary
y <- burglary_m$lag_s_burglary
xx <- data_frame(x,y)
moran.plot(x, lw_m)
```

We are now going to create a new variable to identify the quadrant in which each observation falls within the Moran Scatter plot, so that we can tell apart the high-high, low-low, high-low, and low-high areas. We will only identify those that are significant according to the p value that was provided by the local moran function.

Before we get started, let's quickly review the tools we will use. 

All our data is in this "burglary_m" dataframe. This has a variable for the LSOA code ("code"), a variable for the number of burglaries ("burglary"), and then also the two variables we created, the scaled measure of burglary ("s_burglary"), and the spatial lag measure ("lag_s_burglary").

We also have our "locm_bm" object, which we created with the "localmoran()" function, that has calculated a variety of measures for each of our observations, which we explored with the `summary()` function. You can see (if you scroll up) that the 5th element in this object is the p-value ("Pr(z > 0)"). To call the nth element of an object, you can use the square brackets after its name. So to return the nth column of thing, you can use `thing[,n]`. Again this should not be new to you, as we've been doing this sort of thing for a while. 

So the data we need for each observation, in order to identify whether it belongs to the high-high, low-low, high-low, or low-high quadrants are the standardised burglary score, the spatial lag score, and the p-value. 

Essentially all we'll be doing, is assigning a variable values based on where in the plot it is. So for example, if it's in the upper right, it is high-high, and has values larger than 0 for both the burglary and the spatial lag values.  It it's in the upper left, it's low-high, and has a value larger than 0 for the spatial lag value, but lower than 0 on the burglary value. And so on, and so on. Here's an image to illustrate:

![](img/moran_plot_annotate.png)


So let's first initialise this variable. In this instance we are creating a new column in the "burglary_m" dataframe and calling it "quad_sig". 

We are using the `mutate()` function from the `dplyr` package to create our new variable, just as we have in previous labs. 

We also use nested `ifelse()` statements. Nested `ifelse()` just means that it's an `ifelse()` inside another `ifelse()` statement. To help us with these sorts of situations is the `ifelse()` function. We saw this with the previous exercises, but I'll describe it brielfy again. It allows us to conditionally assign some value to some variable. The structure of the function is so that you have to pass it a condition, then a value to assign if the condition is true, and then another value if the condition is false. You are basically using this function to say: "if this condition is true, do first thing, else, do the second thing". It would look something like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}

dataframe$new_variable <- ifelse(dataframe$some_numeric_var < 100, "smaller than 100", "not smaller than 100")

```

When nesting these, all you do is put another condition to check in the "thing to do if false", so it checks all conditions. So in the first instance we check if the value for burglary is greater than zero, and the value for the lag is greater than zero, and the p-value is smaller than our threshold of 0.05. If it is, then this should belong to the "high-high" group. If any one of these conditions is not met, then we move into the 'thing to do if false' section, where we now check again another set of criteria, and so on and so on. If none of these are met, we assign it the non-significant value: 


```{r}
burglary_m <- st_as_sf(burglary_m) %>% 
  mutate(quad_sig = ifelse(burglary_m$s_burglary > 0 & 
                              burglary_m$lag_s_burglary > 0 & 
                              locm_bm[,5] <= 0.05, 
                     "high-high",
                     ifelse(burglary_m$s_burglary <= 0 & 
                              burglary_m$lag_s_burglary <= 0 & 
                              locm_bm[,5] <= 0.05, 
                     "low-low", 
                     ifelse(burglary_m$s_burglary > 0 & 
                              burglary_m$lag_s_burglary <= 0 & 
                              locm_bm[,5] <= 0.05, 
                     "high-low",
                     ifelse(burglary_m$s_burglary <= 0 & 
                              burglary_m$lag_s_burglary > 0 & 
                              locm_bm[,5] <= 0.05,
                     "low-high", 
                     "non-significant")))))
```


(Note we had to wrap our data in a `st_as_sf()` function, to convert back to `sf` object). 

Now we can have a look at what this returns us: 

```{r}

table(burglary_m$quad_sig)

```

This looks like a lot of non-significant results. We want to be sure this isn't an artefact of our code but is true, we can check how many values are under 0.05:


```{r}

nrow(locm_bm[locm_bm[,5] <= 0.05,])

```

We can see that only 23 areas have p-values under 0.05 threshold. So this is in line with our results, and we can rest assured. Well, this is exciting, but where are these regions?

Let's put'em on a map, using the standard colours used in this kind of maps:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tmap_mode("view")
```


```{r}

tm_shape(burglary_m) + 
  tm_fill("quad_sig",
          palette= c("red","blue","white"),
          labels = c("High-High","Low-Low", "non-significant"),
          alpha=0.5) +
  tm_borders(alpha=.5) +
  tm_layout(frame = FALSE,
            legend.position = c("right", "bottom"), 
            legend.title.size = 0.8,
            legend.text.size = 0.5,
            main.title = "LISA with the p-values",
            main.title.position = "centre",
            main.title.size = 1.2)
```

So how do we interpret these results? Well keep in mind: 

- The LISA value for each location is determined from its individual contribution to the global Moran's I calculation.
- Whether or not this value is statistically significant is assessed by comparing the actual value to the value calculated for the same location by randomly reassigning the data among all the areal units and recalculating the values each time (the Monte Carlo simulation approach discussed earlier).

So essentially this map now tells us that there was statistically significant moderate clustering in burglaries in Manchester. If you were familiar with the city you could see they are located around the city centre, areas of university student residencies, and some pockets of social exclusion.  When reporting your results, report at least the Moran’s I test value and the p value.  So, for this test, you should report Moran’s I = 0.32, p < .001. Including the LISA cluster map is also a great way of showing how the attribute is actually clustering.


## Scan Statistics

```{r}
names(neighbourhoods)
```

compute rate

```{r, eval = FALSE}

neighbourhoods <- neighbourhoods %>%
  mutate(b_e_rate = b_e_count / as.numeric(dwellings))
```

What´s going on? Well, that´s the thing with real life data. There´s always something that may drive you insane. If you use `class()` on the column with the "dwellings" you will see that the data are stored as `character` class. What is more you see commas separating some of the digits. R will coerce this into NAs. So we need to do some tidying beforehand. We will turn the vector into numeric using `as.numeric()` and we will use `gsub()` to replace the commas (`","`) with nothingness (`""`).

```{r}
neighbourhoods$dwellings <- as.numeric(gsub(",", "", neighbourhoods$dwellings))

```

Now we can compute the rate and do a quick map.

```{r, message=FALSE}
neighbourhoods <- neighbourhoods %>%
  mutate(b_e_rate = (b_e_count / as.numeric(dwellings)) * 1000)
current_style <- tmap_style("col_blind")
tm_shape(neighbourhoods) + 
  tm_fill("b_e_rate", style="headtails", title = "Break and Enter per 1000 dwellings (2018-2019") +
  tm_layout(legend.position = c("left", "top"), 
            legend.title.size = 0.7,
            legend.text.size = 0.5)
```

The package `DCluster` was one of the first to introduce tools to assess spatial clusters. This package, like many that are influenced by the epidemiological literature, take as key inputs the observed cases (in criminology this will be criminal occurrences) and expected cases. In epidemiology expected cases are often standardised to account for population heterogeneity. In crime analysis this is not as common (although in some circumstances it should be!). For this example we will the  expected counts are computed using the overall incidence ratio (i.e., total number of cases divided by the total population).

```{r}
neighbourhoods$b_e_expected <- neighbourhoods$dwellings * sum(neighbourhoods$b_e_count) / sum(neighbourhoods$dwellings)

```

This package requires as well the centroids for the polygons we are using. To extract this we can use `sf::st_centroid()` with `sf::st_coordinates()`. All the GEOS functions underlying `sf` need projected coordinates to work properly, so we need to reproject first to an adequate projection:

```{r}
# Reproject
neighbourhoods <- st_transform(neighbourhoods, crs = 26717)
# Get coordinates for centroids
nh_centroid <- st_centroid(neighbourhoods) %>%
  st_coordinates(nh_centroid)
# Place the coordinates as vectors in our sf dataframe
neighbourhoods$x <- nh_centroid[,1]
neighbourhoods$y <- nh_centroid[,2]

```
