# Appendix C: sourcing geographical data for crime analysis

When you get to the link, you will see on the top there is some notification to help you with the boundary data selector. If in the future you are looking for UK boundary data and you are feeling unsure at any point, feel free to click on that note "**How to use Boundary Data Selector**" which will help to guide you. In other countries you have similar data repositories where you can get the relevant census geographies (see Appendix B for details) and there are also some websites that aim to provide this data for all countries (http://www.diva-gis.org/gdata).  


[boundary selector](https://borders.ukdataservice.ac.uk/bds.html) Can use example of how to get *Local Authority Districts* for *England* (for the EU ref example in Chapter 4?) 

In this case that means select "English Districts, UAs and London Boroughs, 2011":

Once you have the file, download, extract (unzip) and put the folder in your working directory. Mine is in a subfolder in my working directory called data, so I point R inside that folder to find my shape file. 

So you can see immediately that there are some documentations around the usage of this shapefile, in the "README.txt" and the "TermsAndConditionshtml" files. They contain information about how you can use this map. For example, all your maps will have to mention where you got all the data from. So since you got this boundary data from the UKDS, you will have to note the following: 

"Contains National Statistics data © Crown copyright and database right [year]
    Contains OS data © Crown copyright [and database right] (year)"

You can read more about this in the terms and conditions document once we unzip the file.

Let´s now unzip all these files:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
#First you need to decide where you want to place the folders. 
# In my machine I will use the following location, but you will 
# need to use whatever is appropriate for you.
outdir <- "C:/crime_mapping/data/BoundaryData"
#Then you can unzip the file to this folder
unzip(tf, exdir = outdir)

```
