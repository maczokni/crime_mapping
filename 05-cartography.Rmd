# Chapter 5: Visualisation: good cartographic design

## Introduction

This chapter aims to focus on introducing good practice in map design and presentation. When putting a map together you need to think about its intended audience (their level of expertise, whether you want them to interact with the map), purpose, and format of delivery (e.g., printed, web, projected in a screen, etc). There are many design decisions you need to consider: fonts, labels, colour, legends, layout, etc. In this chapter we provide a general introduction to some basic design principles for map production. We will work you through an example of a fairly basic map and the process of taking to a point where it could be ready for presentation to an audience other that yourself.
